# Qscoreboard
Qscoreboard is a software that can turn your computer into a scoreboard. 
Do you organize a match, league, or cup? You don't need to buy a scoreboard, just download Qscoreboard and make use of your computer screens.
Scoreboard application was originally created for waterpolo (and its 2019 rules) but can also be used for many other sports.

## Installation
Download [latest release .7z file](https://github.com/danividanivi/Qscoreboard/releases) and extract it in desired folder.
Make sure all the screens you are planning to use are connected to your computer.
### For Windows
Run Qscoreboard.exe and test everything is working as expected.

## User Guide
Main screen is displayed when you run Qscoreboard.
You can interact with all controls by using touchpad, mouse, or touchscreen.
Use a keyboard or screen keyboard to enter numbers.

If you have a secondary screen to show game status to viewers, activate it pressing **Add Screen**
If you have more screens to show timeoff, activate them pressing **Add Screen 30**
After adding any screen, make sure focus is still on Main Screen by clicking in it, otherwhise keyboard shorcuts won't work.

You may be able to compile it and use it in a different platform and Operating System, if you do so please let me know it.
